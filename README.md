# Advent of Code 2023

This repository contains my solutions/attempts for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenge. 

I'm using this as an opportunity to learn [Go](https://golang.org/), so the code may not be the most idiomatic. 

Please feel free to use this code as you wish, but please don't use it to cheat. Thanks!
