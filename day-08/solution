[xxA, xxA, xxA, ...]

all of them are going to end up in some 

[xxZ, xxZ, xxZ, ...]

We have an instruction that loops for ever.


for some arbitrary number of instructions, let say its D.

D1 = m1 * len(I) + n1

xxA -> xxB -> ... -> xxZ

D2 = m2 * len(I) + n2

xxA -> xxB -> ... -> xxZ


LCM (least common multiple of all paths)
