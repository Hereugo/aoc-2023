T = t1 + t2

t1 - time spent holding the button
t2 - time spend driving the car

a = 1 millimeter / millisecond (CONST)
v = t1 * a - where a is the acceleration of the car

d = v * t2
d = t1 * a * t2
d = t1 * t2

d = t1 * (T - t1)
D = t1 * T - t1^2

two possible solutions:
x1 and x2

|x2 - x1| is the number of ways to press the button to make car travel more than D millimeters

a = -1
b = T
c = -D

using quadratic formula we get:

x1 = (-b + sqrt(DD)) / 2a
x2 = (-b - sqrt(DD)) / 2a

Since it involves more math based approach, let choose an appropriate language for it.

and that would be
